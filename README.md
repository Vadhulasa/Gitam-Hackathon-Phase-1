# Gitam-Hackathon-Phase-1

Topic: Internal website to sell/buy the books from Seniors/Juniors. 

Step 1 : Create a registration page for students to register themselves in the website. 
Step 2 : Login page - After validating their details from registration page, we can create a - database to store their details and from that db, we can check the login credentials.
Step 3 : Redirect to another page that shows two options: BUY/SELL Books. 
Step 4 : If it is Buy, we have to take few details from the students like domain (cse, civil,etc...), Subject they're looking for, year/semester etc. 
If it is sell, same details to be added + picture of the book additionally & upload option. 
Step 5 : For buy, once they select all the details, o we should display the books that matches the search, including the prize of the book. 
Also, an add option to add the book inside the cart. For sell, we don't need next step, uploading book in Step-4 is last. 

So, we create registration page, Login page, buy/sell page, displaying books page, uploading books (these are all the web pages we create).
